*Course / Lab:* Digital Forensics Lab  
*Experiment No.:* 2  
*Title:* Recover Deleted or Damaged Files Using TestDisk  

---

## Aim
To recover lost partitions and deleted files using TestDisk.

---

## Requirements
- TestDisk  
- Windows  

---

## Description
- TestDisk is an open-source forensic tool used for recovering lost partitions and repairing damaged boot sectors.  
- It can restore accidentally deleted files from FAT, NTFS, ext2/ext3 file systems.  
- Investigators use it to quickly recover inaccessible data and make disks bootable again.

## Procedure â€” Steps to Recover Data Using TestDisk

*Step-1:* Launch the TestDisk tool. In the terminal window, select *Create* to make a new log file and press *Enter*.

*Step-2:* TestDisk will list available disks (HDDs, SSDs, USB drives). Use the arrow keys to highlight the disk you want to analyze and press *Enter*.

*Step-3:* TestDisk usually auto-detects the partition table (Intel/PC, EFI GPT, Mac, etc.). Verify and press *Enter*.

*Step-4:* Analyze the current partition structure. From the terminal, select *Analyse* and press *Enter*.

*Step-5:* After analysis, you will be asked to perform *Quick Search. Select it and press **Enter*.

*Step-8:* If Quick Search does not find your partition/files, select *Deeper Search* and press *Enter*. This takes longer but finds more recoverable partitions.

*Step-9:* Once you are confident the partition is correct, select *Write* and press *Enter*.

- Once recovery is complete, exit TestDisk by selecting *Quit*.  
- Verify recovered files in the destination folder.

## Expected Output
- TestDisk detects lost or deleted partitions.  
- Files marked as deleted are listed and successfully copied to a safe location.  
- Recovery is possible without altering the original disk contents.
