# Ex.No. 8: Use Steg-Expose to Detect Hidden Data in Images

**Course / Lab:** Digital Forensics Lab
**Experiment No.:** 8
**Title:** Use Steg-Expose to Detect Hidden Data in Images

---

## Description
**StegExpose** is a specialized tool used for **steganography analysis**. It works by evaluating the **statistical properties** of an image to estimate the probability of hidden data being embedded within it. This process helps forensic investigators detect steganography techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** StegExpose is a Java-based application and requires JRE to run.
- **StegExpose Tool:** Download the latest `.jar` file from the official StegExpose GitHub repository.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Download and Set Up StegExpose

1.  **Download the tool:** Obtain the `StegExpose.jar` file from the GitHub repository.
2.  **Install Java:** Ensure JRE is installed on your machine.
3.  **Prepare environment:** Place the `StegExpose.jar` file in a dedicated working folder.

### 2. Select Images for Analysis

* Collect the images you suspect might contain hidden data.
* StegExpose supports common image formats such as **.png**, **.jpg**, and **.bmp**.

### 3. Open Command Line or Terminal

* Navigate to the folder where the `StegExpose.jar` file is located using your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux/macOS).

### 4. Run StegExpose on an Image

* Use the following command structure to analyze a single image for hidden data:

    **Command Structure:**
    ```bash
    java -jar StegExpose.jar <image_file_path>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    java -jar StegExpose.jar test_image.png
    ```

### 5. Analyze the Output

* StegExpose calculates a **"suspect" score** ranging from 0 to 1. **The higher the score, the more likely steganography is present.**

| Score Range | Interpretation (Suggested Thresholds) |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Less than 0.2** | Image is considered **clean** (no hidden data detected). |
| **0.2 - 0.3** | **Possibly** some hidden data is present. |
| **Above 0.3** | **Likely** that steganography is present. |

* **Example Output Analysis:**
    ```bash
    java -jar StegExpose.jar suspect_image.png
    ```
    ```makefile
    Analyzing suspect_image.png...
    Result: 0.4
    Steganography likely present
    ```

### 6. Batch Analysis (Multiple Images)

* To check multiple images at once, specify the folder path containing the images:

    **Command Structure:**
    ```bash
    java -jar StegExpose.jar <folder_path>
    ```

### 7. Advanced Options (Optional)

* To view additional parameters, such as options for adjusting detection sensitivity or output verbosity, use the `--help` flag:

    **Command:**
    ```bash
    java -jar StegExpose.jar --help
    ```

### 8. Review the Results

* Review the scores generated for each image and use the threshold values to determine which images require further forensic investigation to extract the suspected hidden data.

**Result:**

The hidden data within the image was successfully detected using StegExpose. The analysis revealed that images with a suspect score above the threshold likely contain embedded steganographic content, confirming the tool’s effectiveness in steganography detection.
